# JSequel
A small framework for controlling your API endpoints from the frontend. Much
like GraphQL but lighter and less obtrusive to your already complicated
stack. 

All **JSequel** does is make mysql query strings so it's also fast.

### Select
It allows you to build your database query in the frontend like...

```js
{
  name: 'macDonalds.employees',
  columns: [
    {name: 'firstName'},
    {name: 'lastName'},
    {name: 'age'}
  ],
  where: [
    'firstName = "Jimmy"'
  ]
}
```

Which get's parsed as the following once it reaches MYSQL...

```sql
SELECT
macDonalds.employees.firstName,
macDonalds.employees.lastName,
macDonalds.employees.age

FROM
macDonalds.employees

WHERE
macDonalds.employees.firstName = "Jimmy"
```

So all we need is one endpoint that accepts **JSequal** objects and we can use it to replace
potentially hundreds of endpoints.

### Where
You'll notice `where` is an array. That's so we can add extra ones for multiple ANDs.

```js
{
  name: 'macDonalds.employees',
  columns: [
    {name: 'firstName'},
    {name: 'lastName'},
    {name: 'age'}
  ],
  where: [
    'firstName = "Jimmy"',
    // ...AND
    'lastName = "Stansfield"',
  ]
}
```

You can also put any kind of MYSQL condition inside each `where` string.

```js
where: [
  'firstName IS NOT NULL',
  'firstName != "Peter"',
  'age > 21',
  'age <= 32'
]
```

### Limit and Sort
Add a `limit` array and `sort` string to the object.

```js
{
  name: 'macDonalds.employees',
  columns: [
    {name: 'firstName'},
    {name: 'lastName'},
    {name: 'age'}
  ],
  limit: [0, 10],
  sort: 'lastName'
}
```

Add 'desc' to the `sort` string to reverse the sorting order.
```js
sort: 'lastName desc'
```

### Joins
Jsequel's API is very simple because every `Object` in a query is exactly the same.
Here are all the possible keys in a Jsequel object.

```js
{
  name: String,
  columns: [Object],
  where: [String],
  limit: [Number,Number],
  sort: String,
  as: String
}
```

The `columns` array is normally used to select which table columns you want to return
using the `name` param but if you add another `columns` and a `where` to it you can make
a join to another table.

```js
{
  name: 'macDonalds.customers',
  columns: [
    {name: 'firstName'},
    {name: 'lastName'},
    {
      name: 'macDonalds.meals',
      columns: [
        {name: 'title'},
        {name: 'price'}
      ],
      where: ['meals.mealKey = customers.favouriteMealKey']
    }
  ],
  where: ['customers.firstName = "Bill"']
}
```

If you've had any experience with [serverless](https://serverless.com/) lambda functions
you'll know that if you want more than about 20 endpoints in a project, things start to
get pretty mad.

Lots of devs have turned to [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for this very reason but for
my particular needs I thought GraphQL was a bit overkill.

**JSequel** is light and fast because all it does is build mysql query strings. This means 
it can easily be added to your project without disrupting whatever structure you've already built.
It also works with a schema so it's safe as well.

## Node usage
```js
// Use any mysql package from npm...
const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');
const connection = require('../libs/connection');

// Import your schema, more on this later.
const schema = require('../schema');

// Import JSequel...
const JSeq = require('jsequel');


async function example() {

  // Connect to mysql...
  const con = await mysql.createConnection(connection);

  // Make a new JSequel instance using your chosen schema.
  const jSeq= new JSeq(schema);

  // We're doing a get here so use selectQL and pass it your JSequel object...
  let queryObj = jSeq.selectSQ({
    name: 'macDonalds.employees',
    columns: [
      {name: 'firstName'},
      {name: 'lastName'},
      {name: 'age'}
    ],
    where: [
      'firstName = "Jimmy"',
      'lastName = "Stansfield"',
    ]
  });

  // Check the status of the returned object.
  if (queryObj.status === 'error') {
    console.log(queryObj);
    return;
  }

  let result;

  // JSequel will put your mysql string onto a param called query...
  try {
    result = await con.query(queryObj.query)
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }
  console.log('result :', result[0]);
  await con.end()
}
```

### Create
If you want to make a **CREATE** just add some `data`:

```js
let data = {
  _id: '123',
  firstName: 'Bob',
  lastName: 'Smith'
}

jSeq.createSQ({
  name: 'macDonalds.employees'
}, data);
```

### Update
To make an **UPDATE** just add a `where`.

```js
let data = {
  firstName: 'Bobby'
}

jSeq.updateSQ({
  name: 'macDonalds.employees',
  where: ['_id = "123"']
}, data);
```

**Note**: To update a record with a NULL value assign the string 'NULL' to it.

# Schema
You'll need a schema for your database, this will prevent anyone from injecting dangerous
SQL into your db without **JSequel** stamping it out.

The structure of your schema object should look like:

```js
module.exports = {
  databaseName: {
    tableName1: {
      column1: {
        type: 'string'
      },
      column2: {
        type: 'string',
      }
    },
    tableName2: {
      column1: {
        type: 'number'
      }
    }
  }
  databaseName2: {
    // etc...
  }
}
```
Any columns not included in the schema will be automatically omitted from your queries.

# Functions
You can use any of MYSQLs in-built functions by adding the function name to any `name` param.

```js
{
  name: 'macDonalds.employees',
  columns: [
    {name: 'concat=>(firstName " " lastName)', as: 'fullName'}
  ]
}
```

This will evaluate to

```sql
SELECT
CONCAT(firstName, " ", lastName) AS fullName

FROM
macDonalds.employees
```

You can nest functions inside one another.

```js
name: 'concat=>("Todays date: " date=>())'
```

All function names must be preceeded by `=>()`. All arguments are 
seperated by a single space unless inside a " string ".

# Custom Functions
Add custom functions using `addCustomFns` in your node controller
to make any kind of custom selection.

```js
const jseq = new JSQ(schema);

jseq.addCustomFns({
  firstAndLast: () => {
    return 'CONCAT(firstName, " ", lastName)';
  }
});

let jqueryObj = jseq.selectQL({
  name: 'macDonalds.employees',
  columns: [
    {name: 'firstAndLast=>()', as: 'fullName'}
  ]
});
```

A custom function must always return a string.

You can also add arguments to custom functions...

```js
{name: 'firstAndLast=>(firstName " " lastName)', as: 'fullName'}
```

That'll be passed through as individual strings.

```js
firstAndLast(first, space, last) {
  return `CONCAT(${first}, ${space}, ${last})`;
}
```

Custom functions can be used to replace a whole query. If you 
want JSequel to do something a bit more complicated, make
the whole query inside the custom function and then call it
inside the first `name` param.

```js
jseq.addCustomFns({
  unionRecords: (...columns) => {
    return columns.map(colName => (
      `
        SELECT
        *
        FROM
        ${colName}
      `
    )).join(' UNION ');
  }
});

let jqueryObj = jseq.selectQL({
  name: 'unionRecords=>(macDonalds.orders macDonalds.meals)'
});
```

# JQString (Json Query Strings)
For tables with json type fields you can use a json query string to select specific values in an array.
All json query strings must start with a `$`, after that they're the same as javascript syntax.

Say you had a json column with an array of objects.

```sql
_____________________________
| mealTypes                 |
-----------------------------
|[                          |
| {                         |
|    type: 'burger',        |
|    name: 'Big Mac'        |  
| },                        |
| {                         |
|   type: 'chicken',        | 
|   name: 'Chicken Zinger'  |
| },                        |
| {                         |
|   type: 'sandwich',       |
|   name: 'The Chopper'     |
| },                        |
|]                          |
|                           |
```

```js
{
  name: 'macDonalds.orders'
  columns: [
    {name: '$mealTypes[0]', as: 'firstMealObject'},
  ]
}

// Would return...
// orders: [{
//   firstMealObject: {
//     type: 'burger',
//     name: 'Big Mac'
//   }
// }]
```

You can search the json column by any string value within using a string that starts with a '?'.

```js
{
  name: 'macDonalds.orders'
  columns: [
    {name: '$mealTypes[?Big Mac].type', as: 'biggMacType'}
  ]
}
// Would return...
// orders: [{
//   biggMacType: 'burger'
// }]
```
This finds an object in an array of objects by searching for the string 'Big Mac' then 
returns whatever is assigned to the key called `type`.

You can use **jQStrings** wherever you find a `name` parameter or to use them inside a function
argument just wrap the string in quotes...

```js
{name: 'concat=>("Â£" "$mealTypes[?Sandwich].price")'}
```

They are also compatible with the `data` sent to an `updateQL` function.
Rather than adding the **jQString** as a value, instead it goes in place of the *keyname* of the value you want to update.
This will only update the `value` param of the first object in the `jsonForm` array to have the string 'Jan'.

```js
updateQL({
  db: 'campaigns',
  table: 'bookings',
  where: [{name: 'bookingsKey', is: '"123"'}]
}, {
  "$jsonForm[0].value": 'Jan'
});
```

### JSON
JSequel will handle your json objects natively so you can just put them straight into your data
without having to do any `JSON.stringify` nonsense.

```js
jSeq.updateSQ({
  name: 'macDonalds.employees',
  where: ['_id = "123"']
}, {
  jsonForm: { label: 'Name', value: 'Jim', type: 'input' }
});
```

This project is basically a simplified v2 of [JsonQL](https://github.com/seanwarman/jsonQL). If you want
an idea of the roadmap for **JSequel** you can check out that project.

### MongoDB-like associations
Add an `as` to a nested column and JSequel will return those records inside an array.

So rather than starting with the `customer` to find their favourite meal you can start
with the meal and list every customer who has that meal as their favourite.
```js
{
  name: 'macDonalds.meals',
  columns: [
    {name: 'title'},
    {
      name: 'macDonalds.customers',
      columns: [
        {name: 'firstName'},
        {name: 'lastName'}
      ],
      where: ['meals.mealKey = customers.favouriteMealKey'],
      as: 'customersWhoLike' // <<
    }
  ],
  where: ['title = "Big Mac"']
}
```

This is very un-mysqlish but really useful for modern web apps.
```js
// Result...
{
  title: 'Big Mac',
  customersWhoLike: [
    {firstName: 'bill', lastName: 'ray'},
    {firstName: 'gemma', lastName: 'stonebridge'},
    // ...etc
  ]
}
```

When using nested jsons you must stick to more mongo-like results. So rather than 
doing mysql joins and having data from associate tables included in your results
you'll have to instead nest the results of associated tables.

# Example
This is how I currently use JSequel with a frontend app project. 

I have four endpoints in my backend project for each CRUD method. They'd look a bit like this
in an ExpressJS backend...

```js
app.get('/jseq/:queryObj', myGetController);
app.post('/jseq/:queryObj', myPostController);
app.put('/jseq/:queryObj', myPutController);
app.delete('/jseq/:queryObj', myDeleteController);
```

Each controller looks like the node example further above, except they will use `jseq.selectSQ` for the GET,
`jseq.createSQ` for the POST, `jseq.updateSQ` for the PUT and `jseq.deleteSQ` for the DELETE.

Using a ajax method like `fetch` or `axios` I'd just send my request to one of the above endpoints using the appropriate CRUD method. 
```js
axios.get(`/jseq/${queryObj}`);
```
You can use the native javascript method `encodeURIComponent` with `JSON.stringify` to put the object directly 
into the URL which allows you to send the object without putting anything into the `body` of the request.

```js
const queryObj = decodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify({
  name: 'mcDonalds.employees',
  columns: [
    {name: 'firstName'},
    {name: 'lastName'},
    {name: 'telephone'},
  ]
}))


const employees = await axios.get(`/jseq/${queryObj}`);
```


**Note**: You cannot currently `limit` or `sort` nested jsons due to limitations
in mysql. Also note that any version before mysql 8.0 will replace duplicate keys
giving priority to the *first* key name it finds, unlike javascript.

for reference.
